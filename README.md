![Imagine a Grid...](/Vectors/Assets.xcassets/grid_logo.imageset/grid.png)

You start off with a 7x7 blank grid and an 2-color challenge grid image. 
Your task is to color the blank grid until it matches the challenge image. 
The catch is that you __cannot color individual tiles__ on your grid. You can 
only __color a single row or a single column__ with one color at a time.

Depending on how difficult or simple the game is, I will modify the rules.
For example, right now with these limitations it is near impossible to draw 
images with diagonals, such as a diamond.
