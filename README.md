# Vectors

You start off with a 7x7 blank grid and an 2-color challenge grid image. 
Your task is to color the blank grid until it matches the challenge image. 

The catch is that you cannot color individual tiles on your grid. 
You are only color a single row or a single column with one color at a time.

Depending on how difficult or simple the game is, I will modify the rules.
For example, right now with these limitations it is impossible to draw images
with diagonals, such as a diamond.
